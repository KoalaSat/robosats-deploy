## Example environment and configuration files
You can think of these as "Namespaces" for your orchestration.
You can find a LND Testnet example (lndtn) in `/compose/env-sample/lndtn` that will create containers suffixed with `-lndtn` and a CLN Testnet example in `/compose/env-sample/clntn` using the suffix `-clntn` .
